# RestartOnEmpty    
RestartOnEmpty is a simple, lightweight plugin I made to restart my Minecraft server when it's empty.    
For it to work, you need to ensure settings.restart_script is set correctly in spigot.yml, or have a panel or manager that automatically restarts a server when it stops normally.
