# AshUtils
This is a bespoke general plugin for the demands of asheiou.cymru. I don't recommend running it outside of this environment.    
    
## Setup
You need to ensure settings.restart_script is set correctly in spigot.yml, or have a panel or manager that automatically restarts a server when it stops normally.

## Dependencies
This plugin softdepends DiscordSRV, Essentials, and Vault. Without these plugins, most features of this plugin will not be available.
